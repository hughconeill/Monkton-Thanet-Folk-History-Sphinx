# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Sphinx documentation site recording the history of Monkton (Thanet, Kent) — led by
Stuart Horsburgh — currently focused on St Mary Magdalene church: its architecture,
clergy back to 1291, bells, war memorial, and a full churchyard survey. Content is
Markdown via MyST, rendered with the Furo theme, and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Commands

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate          # venv already exists at .venv/
pip install -r requirements.txt    # install/update deps

make html                          # build to build/html/
make clean                         # remove build/
make livehtml                      # live-reload dev server (needs sphinx-autobuild,
                                    #   not currently in requirements.txt — pip install it first)
python3 -m http.server -d build/html 8000   # serve a built site locally
```

There is no test suite or linter configured — "correctness" here means the site builds
without Sphinx warnings/errors and renders as expected.

## Architecture

- `source/conf.py` — Sphinx config: MyST + `sphinx_copybutton` + `sphinx_design`
  extensions, Furo theme, brand colors, logo/favicon. Also loads
  `source/_static/custom.css` (via `html_css_files`) for style tweaks the
  theme's `html_theme_options` can't express — currently just left-aligning
  the sidebar logo, which Furo centers by default.
- `source/index.md` — home page. Its `toctree` is the actual site nav; only pages
  listed there (directly or via a nested `toctree`) are reachable/built into the
  visible site. **When adding a new page, it must be added to a `toctree` or it
  won't appear in the sidebar.**
- **Live content**: `source/church/` and `source/history/` are linked from
  `index.md`. `source/church/index.md` has its own `toctree` fanning out to
  `short-guide.md`, `bells.md`, `clergy.md`, `churchyard/index.md` (which itself
  fans out to `names-alphabetical.md`, `numbered-stones.md`,
  `survey-by-location.md`, `register-appendix.md` — the churchyard survey data),
  `richard-culmer.md`, `war-memorial.md`, and `memorials-inside.md`.
  `source/history/index.md` fans out to two columns by Terry Marsh, originally
  published in the Monkton News parish magazine and extracted from scanned
  `.docx` copies: `monkton-memories/` (childhood/village-life reminiscences,
  numbered `01-`…`06-`) and `farming-life/` (his working life on local farms
  from 1976 on, numbered `01-`…`22-`). Each article page ends with a
  `*Terry Marsh*` byline and an "Originally published in the Monkton News
  (Month Year)." line. New issues of the magazine will surface more instalments
  of both columns later — renumbering/re-titling them then is expected.
- `source/history/index.md` also has a "Featured" table (not a `{grid}`, so it
  reads as one-off rather than a permanent column like Terry Marsh's) linking
  `source/history/monkton-1926.md` (Stuart Horsburgh's 1926 centenary-walk
  article and 4-zone map, plus a downloadable PDF built from the same images —
  see `source/_static/monkton-1926-centenary-mile-walk-map.pdf`) and
  `source/history/origins.md` (Anglo-Saxon/medieval Monkton, sourced from
  British History Online's Hasted transcription and the Kent Archaeological
  Society journal). `source/places.md` (linked from the root `index.md`) lists
  Monkton's 22 Historic England-listed buildings. Unlike the rest of the site,
  these pages cite external web sources with inline Markdown links directly in
  the prose, rather than the footnote-to-`sources.md` convention below — there
  is no `sources.md` in this project (an earlier placeholder version was
  removed; it hasn't been recreated).
- The original scaffold also included `source/history/the-mill.md`,
  `source/history/twentieth-century.md`, `source/people/`, `source/faq.md`,
  `source/timeline.md`, and an earlier placeholder `source/sources.md` —
  these were removed for being unfinished (bracketed placeholders, never
  wired into a `toctree`). They no longer exist; don't assume they're just
  unlinked.
- Images referenced from `history/`/`people/`/church pages sometimes point at
  `_static/images/placeholder-*.jpg` (literal grey placeholders) — replace with real
  scans before treating a page as finished. Some newer pages (e.g. `index.md`,
  `church/index.md`) instead reference images hosted externally on Cloudinary
  (`res.cloudinary.com/monkton/...`).

## Editorial conventions (from `README.md` / `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`)

- **Citations**: the project's original convention (from `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`) was a
  Markdown footnote (`[^label]` ... `[^label]: full citation`) linking back to a
  `source/sources.md` organized by record type — that file no longer exists (see
  above), so this isn't in active use. Pages sourced from the open web
  (`origins.md`, `places.md`, `monkton-1926.md`) instead cite with inline
  Markdown links directly in the prose/a trailing "Source(s):" line, pointing at
  the original page (British History Online, Historic England, Wikipedia, etc.)
  — prefer the most authoritative/primary source available (e.g. link a listed
  building to Historic England's own listing page over a Wikipedia mirror, when
  you have the exact listing URL).
- **Disputed facts**: where sources disagree, say so on the page (see the
  `{admonition}` "Conflicting evidence" pattern) rather than silently picking one.
- **Placeholders**: unresearched sections should stay clearly marked as placeholders
  rather than left blank or invented.
- **Images**: web-sized copies (under ~1MB) go in `source/_static/images/`;
  full-resolution originals are kept outside the repo, noted in `sources.md`. Use the
  `{figure}` directive for numbered captions.

## MyST syntax in use

- `{admonition}` (note/warning/tip), `{figure}`, `{toctree}` — core Sphinx/MyST
- `{grid}` / `{grid-item-card}` (from `sphinx_design`) — the card layouts used on
  `index.md` and section index pages like `church/index.md`
- `{dropdown}`, `:::` colon-fence directives, `{{ }}` substitutions, `- [ ]` task
  lists — enabled via `myst_enable_extensions` in `conf.py`

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml.example` is a template GitHub Pages workflow (build with
`sphinx-build -b html source build/html`, then `actions/deploy-pages`). It is **not**
active yet — rename/copy it to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to enable auto-deploy on
push to `main`. README.md and PROJECT-BRIEF.md both describe it as already active, which
is currently inaccurate.
